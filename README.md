# Snackitude

Capstone project for the BrainStation Full Stack Web Development April-June 2021 course.  
Linking professionals working remotely or dealing with the transition back to office life with users nearby who are already going to the shop, for when that low blood sugar hits and concentration drops.  

## Problem

Sometimes there is simply no chance to break from meetings to pop to the shop for a packet of crisps, so being able to request a snack from someone nearby who is already going, avoiding a minimum charge and outrageous delivery fee will save the day. Other people might live in a village where the nearest shop is a 10 minute drive away, and it is simply not economical to go all that way for a chocolate bar.  

## User Profile

Targeting the WfH demographic to save time, reduce transport emissions, and minimise wastage from impulse buying. Furthermore it could aid the sick, the elderly and people otherwise limited in their capacity to travel, promoting community.  

### Tech Stack and APIs

HTML, SCSS, JS, Node, React, Express, Passport, Git  
MySQL  
Google Maps APIs: Places, Distance Matrix and Maps Embed  

### Further Development

Payment functionality - Stripe, PayPal - as MVP will use cash payments, but using a payment platform will allow easier implementation of the “transnacktion” fee.   
User profiles and personalisation e.g. avatar, snack suggestions, saved location radius.  
Report complaints. - contact email  
Live chat and option to add delivery directions. - done with socket.io and embedded maps  
Better authorisation - so details are anonymous until a request is accepted.  
Public transport options.  
Private Route component for paths once logged in.  
Set radius by time option as well as distance.  
Option to change from filtering by radius to by along a specific route.  
Specific supermarket option for rogue snack options e.g. oat crunchies from sains and waitrose.  
Add store stock checker.
